mystical and magical mineral was consumed by 30 owls. After the ritual the owls began to gain an intelligence far exceeding anyone’s expectations, but there was more. The owls acquired supernatural strength, their physical bodies capable of awe-inspiring feats, they flew high above the sky, far beyond the eyes, higher and higher.</p>\r\n            <p>The owls were unstoppable, they were compelled to find a land so different to the one that they used to call home. That’s when they came upon the moon, a gray celestial body suspended in space with craters far as the eye could see. This would be home, a rearing ground, an owl’s dream for breeding. The original owls, the forefathers eventually disappeared, to a mythical land on the dark side of the moon where no one goes. However, their legacy remains, it still thrives 500 years later to this day as the population of the owls on the moon grew. Now 500 years later, there are over 10,000 owls that exist today that live on different lands on the moon.</p>\r\n              <p>The owls ferociously work from their lands releasing innovative and technologically advanced products from the ‘Owl Lab’ which are utilized by other owls on the moon so that they can flourish and succeed on their lands. It’s rumored that their greatest invention yet ‘The Owl Platform’ which is a price prediction platform for crypto currency, is soon to be released that will forever change the way moon trading works.</p>\r\n              <p>This is the beginning, the first of many inventions to come from the owls who are advancing and innovating at an extraordinary rate. Be sure to check out the “The Owl Lab” for new, unique and ingenious releases from the owls.</p>\r\n            <div class=\"text-center\">\r\n            <!-- <a class=\"btn btn-primary pancakeswap\" >Enter App</a> -->\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"info-sec mb-4\">\r\n            <h2 class=\"nfsize2\">The Owl Vision</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"row align-items-center\">\r\n              <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n              <p>Beyond Owls is a metaverse on the moon that incorporates NFT’s, P2E gaming, Staking, Lands and an AI price prediction model known as the ‘The Owl Platform’.

In AI-Price prediction algorithms we can see the future expected price up-to two months and take fast decision to in-out the market.\r\n          As a result, the days and times are an approximation and indices may take 1-4 hours to fully update or on\r\n          occasion be rebalanced more than their time-horizon to make important technical updates.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"col-lg-12 my-3\">\r\n          <h4 class=\"text-danger\">DISCLAIMER\r\n          Indices of crypto investments, like all types of investment-related information, are subject to risk; they can\r\n          go down as well as up; and relying on such information can lead to losses as well as gains.

This features is based on Deep Learning by which our stacker can take smart decision to avoid loss in trading. In AI-Price prediction algorithms we can see the future expected price up-to two months and take fast decision to in-out the market.\r\n                        As a result, the days and times are an approximation and indices may take 1-4 hours to fully update or on\r\n                        occasion be rebalanced more than their time-horizon to make important technical updates.\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-12 my-3\">\r\n                    <h4 class=\"text-danger\">DISCLAIMER\r\n                    Indices of crypto investments, like all types of investment-related information, are subject to risk; they can\r\n                    go down as well as up; and relying on such information can lead to losses as well as gains.

The selected entries are then associated\r\n * with that output, and removed from the /remaining UTxO set/.\r\n *\r\n * This phase ends when every output has been associated with a selection of\r\n * UTxO entries.\r\n *\r\n * However, if the remaining UTxO set is completely exhausted before all\r\n * outputs can be processed, the algorithm terminates with an error.\r\n *\r\n * === Phase 2: Improvement\r\n *\r\n * __In this phase, the algorithm attempts to improve upon each of the UTxO__\r\n * __selections made in the previous phase, by conservatively expanding the__\r\n * __selection made for each output.__\r\n *\r\n * During this phase, the algorithm:\r\n *\r\n *   *  processes outputs in /ascending order of coin value/.\r\n *\r\n *   *  continues to maintain the /remaining UTxO set/ produced by the previous\r\n *      phase.\r\n *\r\n *   *  maintains an /accumulated coin selection/, initiated from previous phase.\r\n *\r\n * For each output of value __/v/__, the algorithm:\r\n *\r\n *  1.  __Calculates a /target range/__ for the total value of inputs used to\r\n *      pay for that output, defined by the triplet:\r\n *\r\n *      (/minimum/, /ideal/, /maximum/) = (/v/, /2v/, /3v/)\r\n *\r\n *  2.  __Attempts to /improve/ upon the /existing UTxO selection/__ for that\r\n *      output, by repeatedly selecting additional entries at random from the\r\n *      /remaining UTxO set/, stopping when the selection can be improved upon\r\n *      no further.\r\n *\r\n *      A selection with value /v1/ is considered to be an /improvement/ over a\r\n *      selection with value /v0/ if __all__ of the following conditions are\r\n *      satisfied:\r\n *\r\n *       * __Condition 1__: we have moved closer to the /ideal/ value:\r\n *\r\n *             abs (/ideal/ − /v1/) < abs (/ideal/ − /v0/)\r\n *\r\n *       * __Condition 2__: we have not exceeded the /maximum/ value:\r\n *\r\n *             /v1/ ≤ /maximum/\r\n *\r\n *       * __Condition 3__: when counting cumulatively across all outputs\r\n *       considered so far, we have not selected more than the /maximum/ number\r\n *       of UTxO entries specified by 'limit'.\r\n *\r\n *  3.  __Creates a /change value/__ for the output, equal to the total value\r\n *      of the /final UTxO selection/ for that output minus the value /v/ of\r\n *      that output.\r\n *\r\n *  4.  __Updates the /accumulated coin selection/__:\r\n *\r\n *       * Adds the /output/ to 'outputs'.\r\n *       * Adds the /improved UTxO selection/ to 'inputs'.\r\n *       * Adds the /change value/ to 'change'.\r\n *\r\n * This phase ends when every output has been processed, __or__ when the\r\n * /remaining UTxO set/ has been exhausted, whichever occurs sooner.\r\n *\r\n * = Termination\r\n *\r\n * When both phases are complete, the algorithm terminates.\r\n *\r\n * The /accumulated coin selection/ and /remaining UTxO set/ are returned to\r\n * the caller.\r\n *\r\n * === Failure Modes\r\n *\r\n * The algorithm terminates with an __error__ if:\r\n *\r\n *  1.  The /total value/ of the initial UTxO set (the amount of money\r\n *      /available/) is /less than/ the total value of the output list (the\r\n *      amount of money /required/).\r\n *\r\n *      See: __'InputsExhaustedError'__.\r\n *\r\n *  2.  The /number/ of UTxO entries needed to pay for the requested outputs\r\n *      would /exceed/ the upper limit specified by 'limit'.\r\n *\r\n *      See: __'InputLimitExceededError'__.\r\n *\r\n * == Motivating Principles\r\n *\r\n * There are several motivating principles behind the design of the algorithm.\r\n *\r\n * === Principle 1: Dust Management\r\n *\r\n * The probability that random selection will choose dust entries from a UTxO\r\n * set increases with the proportion of dust in the set.\r\n *\r\n * Therefore, for a UTxO set with a large amount of dust, there's a high\r\n * probability that a random subset will include a large amount of dust.\r\n *\r\n * === Principle 2: Change Management\r\n *\r\n * Ideally, coin selection algorithms should, over time, create a UTxO set that\r\n * has /useful/ outputs: outputs that will allow us to process future payments\r\n * with a minimum number of inputs.\r\n *\r\n * If for each payment request of value __/v/__ we create a change output of\r\n * /roughly/ the same value __/v/__, then we will end up with a distribution of\r\n * change values that matches the typical value distribution of payment\r\n * requests.\r\n *\r\n * === Principle 3: Performance Management\r\n *\r\n * Searching the UTxO set for additional entries to improve our change outputs\r\n * is /only/ useful if the UTxO set contains entries that are sufficiently\r\n * small enough. But it is precisely when the UTxO set contains many small\r\n * entries that it is less likely for a randomly-chosen UTxO entry to push the\r\n * total above the upper bound.\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @typedef {Value[]} AmountList - List of 'Value' object\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @typedef {TransactionUnspentOutput[]} UTxOList - List of UTxO\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @typedef {Object} UTxOSelection - Coin Selection algorithm core object\r\n * @property {UTxOList} selection - Accumulated UTxO set.\r\n * @property {UTxOList} remaining - Remaining UTxO set.\r\n * @property {UTxOList} subset - Remaining UTxO set.\r\n * @property {Value} amount - UTxO amount of each requested token\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @typedef {Object} ImproveRange - ImproveRange\r\n * @property {Value} ideal - Requested amount * 2\r\n * @property {Value} maximum - Requested amount * 3\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @typedef {Object} SelectionResult - Coin Selection algorithm return\r\n * @property {UTxOList} input - Accumulated UTxO set.\r\n * @property {OutputList} output - Requested outputs.\r\n * @property {UTxOList} remaining - Remaining UTxO set.\r\n * @property {Value} amount - UTxO amount of each requested token\r\n * @property {Value} change - Accumulated change amount.\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @typedef {Object} ProtocolParameters\r\n * @property {int} minUTxO\r\n * @property {int} minFeeA\r\n * @property {int} minFeeB\r\n * @property {int} maxTxSize\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @type {ProtocolParameters}\r\n */\r\nlet protocolParameters = null;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * CoinSelection Module.\r\n * @module src/lib/CoinSelection\r\n */\r\nconst CoinSelection = {\r\n  /**\r\n   * Set protocol parameters required by the algorithm\r\n   * @param {string} minUTxO\r\n   * @param {string} minFeeA\r\n   * @param {string} minFeeB\r\n   * @param {string} maxTxSize\r\n   */\r\n  setProtocolParameters: (minUTxO, minFeeA, minFeeB, maxTxSize) => {\r\n    protocolParameters = {\r\n      minUTxO: minUTxO,\r\n      minFeeA: minFeeA,\r\n      minFeeB: minFeeB,\r\n      maxTxSize: maxTxSize,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n  /**\r\n   * Random-Improve coin selection algorithm\r\n   * @param {UTxOList} inputs - The set of inputs available for selection.\r\n   * @param {TransactionOutputs} outputs - The set of outputs requested for payment.\r\n   * @param {int} limit - A limit on the number of inputs that can be selected.\r\n   * @return {SelectionResult} - Coin Selection algorithm return\r\n   */\r\n  randomImprove: async (inputs, outputs, limit) => {\r\n    if (!protocolParameters)\r\n      throw new Error(\r\n        \"Protocol parameters not set.
