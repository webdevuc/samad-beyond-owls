            <p class="text-logo-color text-left">This tale begins over 500 years ago where a mystical and magical mineral was
                consumed by 30 owls.
                After
                the ritual the owls began to gain an intelligence far exceeding anyone’s expectations, but there was
                more. The owls acquired supernatural strength, their physical bodies capable of awe-inspiring feats,
                they flew high above the sky, far beyond the eyes, higher and higher.</p>
            <p class="text-logo-color text-left">The owls were unstoppable, they were compelled to find a land so different to the
                one that they used
                to
                call home. That’s when they came upon the moon, a gray celestial body suspended in space with
                craters
                far as the eye could see. This would be home, a rearing ground, an owl’s dream for breeding. The
                original owls, the forefathers eventually disappeared, to a mythical land on the dark side of the
                moon
                where no one goes. However, their legacy remains, it still thrives 500 years later to this day as
                the
                population of the owls on the moon grew. Now 500 years later, there are over 10,000 owls that exist
                today that live on different lands on the moon.</p>
            <p class="text-logo-color text-left">The owls ferociously work from their lands releasing innovative and
                technologically advanced products

                succeed on
